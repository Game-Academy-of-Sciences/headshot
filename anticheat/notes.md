One important characteristic thatcould impact the DNNsâ€™ accuracy is the size of the training set which varies between 16 and 8926for  respectively  DiatomSizeReduction  and  ElectricDevices  datasets.  We  should  note  that  twentydatasets contains a relatively small training set (50 or fewer instances) which surprisingly was notan impediment for obtaining high accuracy when applying a very deep architecture such as ResNet.Furthermore, the number of classes varies between 2 (for 31 datasets) and 60 (for the ShapesAlldataset).

Generic for different types of games:
- shooting games -> aim pattern
- sandbox games, tetris, etc. -> movement and position
- platformers, racing games -> turning and movement patterns, velocity, acceleration

## Deep learning for time series classification: a review
Source code at: https://github.com/hfawaz/dl-4-tsc
Trained different types of classifiers with time-series dataset. (CNN, ResNet, t-LeNet, etc.)

- Easy to generate dataset. Use a cheat engine and instrument game code at runtime. https://github.com/jaiverma/headshot
- Reverse engineer android application. For generating timeseries dataset for a game, reverse engineer game logic and instrument via dynamic library injection or with a dynamic binary instrumentation framework such as Frida.
- Sniff network traffic with Wireshark, reverse network packets.
- Mock network traffic with instrumentation framework.
